# üì± **Advisr** - DeFi Advisor Registry

> **The missing link between crypto and traditional finance** üöÄ

## What is Advisr? 

**Advisr** is the first mobile-first DeFi protocol for verifying investment advisors on Hedera. Think "LinkedIn meets Coinbase" - but for financial advisors who want to prove their legitimacy in the crypto space.

### Why we built this üí≠
- Traditional advisor verification is slow and outdated
- Crypto clients can't tell real advisors from scammers  
- No unified place to check advisor credentials
- Web3 needs better reputation systems

##  Core Features

 **Instant Verification** - Register in 30 seconds, get verified by admins
 **Global Registry** - Works across all jurisdictions and regions
 **Cross-Chain Ready** - Built for Hedera, expandable everywhere
 **Mobile Optimized** - Works perfectly on any device
 **Gas Efficient** - Cheap transactions, fast confirmations

##  Quick Setup

### For Developers
```bash
git clone https://github.com/advisr-app/advisr-contracts.git
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

### For Advisors
1. Connect your wallet to [advisr.app](https://advisr.app) 
2. Fill out your profile (name, region, credentials)
3. Submit for verification
4. Get approved and start building trust! 

##  Smart Contract API

### Register as Advisor
```solidity
advisr.registerInvestmentAdvisor(
    "0.0.123456",          // Your Hedera ID  
    "Sarah Chen",          // Your name
    "Singapore"            // Your region
);
```

### Check if Verified
```solidity

```
